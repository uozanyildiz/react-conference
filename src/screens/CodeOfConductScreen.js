      <p className='text-lg mt-10'>
        All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are
        required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will
        enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all
        participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

      <h3 className='text-3xl mt-10'>The Quick Version</h3>
      <p className='text-lg mt-3'>
        Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
        experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and
        expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
        body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology
        choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any
        form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference
        venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online
        media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned
        or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of
        the conference organisers.
      </p>
      <h3 className='text-3xl mt-10'>The Less Quick Version</h3>
      <p className='text-lg mt-3'>
        Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender
        identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
        appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices,
        sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
        following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
        talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
        sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are
        expected to comply immediately. Sponsors are also subject to the
        anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use
        sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including
        volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or
        otherwise create a sexualised environment. If a participant engages in
        harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they
        deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the
        conference with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that
        someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
        contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can
        be identified as theyâ€™ll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.
        Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue
        security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist
        those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the
        conference. We value your attendance. We expect participants to follow
        these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related
        social events.
